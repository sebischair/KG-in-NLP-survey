    abstract = "In pace with developments in the research field of artificial intelligence, knowledge graphs (KGs) have attracted a surge of interest from both academia and industry. As a representation of semantic relations between entities, KGs have proven to be particularly relevant for natural language processing (NLP), experiencing a rapid spread and wide adoption within recent years. Given the increasing amount of research work in this area, several KG-related approaches have been surveyed in the NLP research community. However, a comprehensive study that categorizes established topics and reviews the maturity of individual research streams remains absent to this day. Contributing to closing this gap, we systematically analyzed 507 papers from the literature on KGs in NLP. Our survey encompasses a multifaceted review of tasks, research types, and contributions. As a result, we present a structured overview of the research landscape, provide a taxonomy of tasks, summarize our findings, and highlight directions for future work.",

However, one critical issue for Wikipedia is that the pages in different languages are rarely linked except for the cross-lingual link between pages about the same subject. This could pose serious difficulties to humans and machines who try to seek information from different lingual sources.

Such lexicons remain a scarce resource for most languages. In this paper, we address this lexicon gap by building high-quality sentiment lexicons for 136 major languages.

We propose a novel method of jointly embedding entities and words into the same continuous vector space. The embedding process attempts to preserve the relations between entities in the knowledge graph and the concurrences of words in the text corpus.

Unfortunately, such KGs tend to be severely sparse in terms of number of facts known for a given entity, i.e., have low knowledge density.

Rather, the reader uses his/her knowledge to fill in gaps and create a coherent, mental picture or "scene" depicting what text appears to convey. The scene constitutes an understanding of the text, and can be used to answer questions that go beyond the text.

However, they may provide weak information about domain specific semantic relations for certain tasks such as semantic parsing of natural language queries, where such information about words can be valuable.

However, in practice the availability of KB data varies from language to language, which greatly limits potential usage of knowledge base. In this paper, we propose a novel method to construct or enrich a knowledge base by entity translation with help of another KB but compiled in a different language.

One of the effective tools is the "template", which is often used in many existing RDF Q/A systems. However, few of them study how to generate templates automatically.

Our system learns to relate concepts in science questions to propositions in a fact corpus, stores new concepts and relations in a knowledge graph (KG), and uses the graph to solve questions.

Our method extracts and enriches sentences that refer to an entity pair from a corpus and ranks the sentences according to how well they describe the relationship between the entities.

In addition to the annotation cost, a key challenge for designing such an ontology is to define a coherent slot set while considering their complex relations.

Therefore supervised approaches to both graph-to-text generation and text-to-graph knowledge extraction (semantic parsing) will always suffer from a shortage of domain-specific parallel graph-text data; at the same time, adapting a model trained on a different domain is often impossible due to little or no overlap in entities and relations.

External commonsense knowledge graphs (KGs), such as ConceptNet, provide rich information about words and their relationships. Thus, towards general commonsense learning, we p(...) | ACL | 2020 | 10.18653/v1/2020.deelio-1.9 | Chang, Ting-Yun and  Liu, Yang and  Gopalakrishnan, Karthik and  Hedayatnia, Behnam and  Zhou, Pei and  Hakkani-Tur, Dilek | https://aclanthology.org/2020.deelio-1.9 | Taiwan, United States | augmented language models,  natural language inference | validation research | technique | -

The problem can be formulated in a reinforcement learning (RL) setup, where a policy-based agent sequentially extends its inference path until it reaches a target. However, in an incomplete KG environment, the agent receives low-quality rewards corrupted by false negatives in the training data, which harms generalization at test time.

| Conference Paper | Relation-Aware Bidirectional Path Reasoning for Commonsense Question Answering  | - | Commonsense Question Answering is an important natural language processing (NLP) task that aims to predict the correct answer to a question through commonsense reasoning. Previous studies utilize pre-trained models on large-scale corpora such as BERT, or perform reasoning on knowledge graphs. However, these methods do not explicitly model the \textit{relations} that connect entities, which are informational and can be used to enhance reasoning.

| Conference Paper | Two Training Strategies for Improving Relation Extraction over Universal Graph  | Computational linguistics; Extraction; Knowledge representation; Attention mechanisms; Knowledge graphs; Neural modeling; Pre-training; Relation extraction; State of the art; Text collection; Training strategy; Arts computing(...) | This paper explores how the Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction (DS-RE) can benefit from the use of a Universal Graph (UG), the combination of a Knowledge Graph (KG) and a large-scale text collection. A straightforward extension of a current state-of-the-art neural model for DS-RE with a UG may lead to degradation in performance. We first report that this degradation is associated with the difficulty in learning a UG and then propose two training strategies: (1) Path Type Adaptive Pretraini(...) | ACL | 2021 | - | Dai Q., Inoue N., Takahashi R., Inui K. | https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107315579&partnerID=40&md5=c424387b6941ddb1decdff3e741a8211 | Japan, United States | relation extraction | validation research | technique | -

Querying and aggregating historical data can assist in reducing future exploration risks and costs. However, since the reports are written in unstructured text, it is a challenging task to derive meaningful geological information without manually reading through a large collection of reports, which is a formidable task for geologists.

| Conference Paper | Unsupervised Cross-Domain Prerequisite Chain Learning Using Variational Graph Autoencoders  | - | Learning prerequisite chains is an important task for one to pick up knowledge efficiently in both known and unknown domains. For example, one may be an expert in the natural language processing (NLP) domain, but want to determine the best order in which to learn new concepts in an unfamiliar Computer Vision domain (CV). Both domains share some common concepts, such as machine learning basics and deep learning models. In this paper, we solve the task of unsupervised cross-domain concept prerequi(...) | ACL | 2021 | 10.18653/v1/2021.acl-short.127 | Li, Irene and  Yan, Vanessa and  Li, Tianxiao and  Qu, Rihao and  Radev, Dragomir | https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-short.127 | United States | entity linking,  entity alignment | validation research | technique; resource | -

Therefore, the dialogue system is the main subsystem in the visually impaired navigation system. The purpose of the dialogue system is to understand the user’s intention, gradually establish context through multiple conversations, and finally provide an accurate destination for the navigation system. We use the knowledge graph as the basis of reasoning in the dialogue system, and then update the kn(...) | Scopus | 2021 | 10.3390/app11136057 | Chen C.-H., Shiu M.-F., Chen S.-H. | https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109408603&doi=10.3390%2fapp11136057&partnerID=40&md5=858e4000a2c849838ec0fd50d3cc00dd | Taiwan | conversational interfaces | solution proposal | tool | -
